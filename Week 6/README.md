# CSD_Aliens

## Sample testing repository for CSD

This practical exercise will give you the opportunity to acquire practical experience of test driven development (TDD) in Java or C# and working alongside another developer. You should leverage the collaboration tools within GitHub to assist you in completing this laboratory exercise.  

## Tasks for completion

  1. Decide on a team lead. The lead should:  
  1.1. Fork this repository.  
  1.2. Add the other team member(s) to the forked repository.  
  1.3. Decide whether you are going to use Java or C# to complete the practical exercise.  
  2. Open the relevant IntelliJ or Visual Studio project and examine outline Java or C# classes Raygun and Alien. Allocate one of classes to be implemented to each team member. If the team has 3 members allocate the code to be developed appropriately.  
  3. Each team member should clone a local copy of the group repository.
  4. Configure the local IntelliJ or Visual Studio project for testing, if necessary.
  5. Based on the comments within each class:  
  5.1. Discuss with your team member(s) what unit tests should be written for each class.  
  5.2. Write a test class for the class that was assigned to your team member, not your class!.  
  6. Implement the class (Raygun or Alien) that was assigned to you.
  7. Test your implementation using the test suite developed by your team member in step 4.2. Fix your code implementation as necessary.  
  8. Review your implementation of the class assigned to you (Raygun or Alien) and refactor the code based on the material covered in last weeks lecture.  
  9. Re-run your test suite to ensure that you did not introduce any bugs when refactoring your code.
  10. Sign into the Microsoft Teams group and share two of the changes you made to the code base when refactoring your code. Add a quick explanation as to why you made those changes. Which of Fowlerâ€™s refactoring guidelines did you apply when refactoring the code?
