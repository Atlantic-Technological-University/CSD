# BDDHotel  

## Description  

This directory contains associated simple example of behaviour driven development BDD using C# and the [reqnroll](https://reqnroll.net/) BDD framework. The BDD feature files model two common scenarios associated with  booking a hotel room. The main branch of the repository contains a Visual Studio solution *BDDHotelDemo* with two projects:

- *BDDHotelDemo*: A .NET console project which you can use to create the classes required for the implementation.
- *HotelBDDTests*: A reqnroll BDD test project that uses [xUnit](https://xunit.net/) as the test execution framework.  

A completed version of the projects can be found in the repository branch *bddCompleted*.

You can change the test framework to NUnit or MSTest if you wish by following this [guide](https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/guides/how-to-change-test-execution-framework.html).  

Additional details on configuring other IDEs such as VS Code and reqnroll can be found [here](https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/ide-integrations/index.html).  

Guidance on writing feature files for reqnroll can be found [here](https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/gherkin/index.html) and a concise Gherkin language reference guide is available [here](https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/gherkin/gherkin-reference.html).
